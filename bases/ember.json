    // for many unresolveable type errors, because with *considerable* extra
    // configuration it ends up including many files which are *not* valid and

    // valid Node-resolveable locations and may not have TS-ready types. This

    // modes: "nodenext" in TS 4.7+ and "mixed" in 5.0+ mode. Since Ember apps
    // and addons never emit with `tsc`, this is safe: it makes type-checking do
    // the right thing, but does not result in changes to what gets emitted. We
